## What is VaultiFi? 🔒
[VaultiFi](https://docs.vaultifi.org/) is an interactive [decentralized application (dApp)](https://docs.vaultifi.org/terminology#decentralized-application-dapp) built on Solana allowing projects to expand with customizable interest-bearing programs. These programs, known as [Vaults](https://docs.vaultifi.org/terminology#vaults), allow community developers and [DAO](https://docs.vaultifi.org/terminology#decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao)s to incentivize investors, traders, and DeFi fanatics to earn seamlessly by essentially [staking](https://docs.vaultifi.org/terminology#staking) their tokens in return for more.  

VaultiFi provides an environment for other projects to create customizable "savings accounts" on Solana for their native token projects (spl-token projects).

With Solana communities on the rise, especially with the recent memecoin surge, VaultiFi caters to communities that can thrive from a new benefit in providing a spl-token staking environment.
